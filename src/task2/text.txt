There were many gardens in the village. In the autumn, apples and pears ripened. There were many birds in the gardens. They would hatch their chicks and feed them worms all day long.
The boys have ruined the birds ' nests. The birds have flown away from this village. In the spring, the flowers bloomed on the apple trees, but the worms got into the flowers and ate them. In the autumn, there were no apples or pears on the trees.
The guys realized that the birds were saving their trees, but it was too late
